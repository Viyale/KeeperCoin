KeeperCoin (KPT)

1. Introduction
KeeperCoin DAO Full is a next-generation cryptocurrency designed to preserve Bitcoin’s core principles—limited supply, deflationary tokenomics, and the “code is law” philosophy—while incorporating advanced decentralized governance through a robust DAO framework. This project is engineered to operate autonomously with minimal intervention after deployment, while still allowing the community to update key parameters via proposals.

KeeperCoin DAO Full integrates several innovative features:

Deflationary Mechanisms: Automatic annual burn and dynamic burn on every token transfer gradually reduce the total supply.
DAO Governance: A comprehensive proposal system enables the community to update essential parameters—such as burn rates, fees, treasury management, and timelock delays—without any centralized intervention.
Enhanced Security Controls: Multiple layers of security (ReentrancyGuard, pausability, quorum checks, multi-signature approvals, and strict voting requirements) ensure that all significant actions are executed with broad community support.
Developer Withdrawal Grace: Developer funds become available for withdrawal after a predetermined period (e.g., 5 years); however, if no withdrawal occurs within 1 year after the withdrawal window opens, the remaining allocation is automatically transferred to the DAO treasury.

2. Key Features and Mechanics
2.1 Token Supply and Allocation

Total Supply: KeeperCoin has a fixed total supply of 18,500,000 KPT tokens.
Developer Allocation: Out of the total supply, 600,000 KPT tokens are reserved for the developer.
DAO Treasury: 15% of the total supply (approximately 2,775,000 KPT tokens) is allocated to the DAO treasury. These funds are managed through the DAO governance process and are intended for community-driven projects, improvements, and strategic spending.
2.2 DAO Governance and Parameter Updates

Decentralized Proposals:
All critical parameters (annual burn rate, transfer fee, dynamic burn settings, treasury allocation, quorum, timelock delay, treasury vote weight rate, etc.) can be updated via DAO proposals. This mechanism ensures that the economic model adapts over time according to community decisions.
Proposal Types:
The system supports various proposal types, including:
AnnualBurnChange & AnnualBurnRateChange – Toggle or adjust the annual burn function.
DeveloperWithdrawal & WithdrawalLimitChange – Manage developer fund withdrawals.
WithdrawalBurnChange – Update the burn percentage applied during developer withdrawals.
TransferFeeRateChange & VotingFeeChange – Adjust transfer and voting fees.
EmergencyControl & EmergencyVotingThresholdChange – Pause operations or adjust emergency quorum requirements.
DynamicBurnParametersChange – Modify the tiers and rates used in the dynamic burn mechanism.
TreasurySpending, TreasuryAllocationChange, TreasuryVoteWeightChange, and TreasuryVoterParticipationChange – Oversee treasury fund management, including spending proposals, allocation updates, vote weight settings, and participation requirements.
TimelockDelayChange – Change the enforced waiting period after voting before execution.
Security Controls in Proposals:
Each proposal is subject to strict quorum requirements and a minimum number of unique voters. Proposals involving fund transfers further require additional multi-signature approvals.

2.3 Deflationary Model and Dynamic Burn Mechanism

Annual Burn:
A fixed percentage (e.g., 2% per year) of the total supply is burned automatically, reducing the total supply gradually.
Transfer-Based Dynamic Burn:
Each token transfer triggers a burn that depends on the sender’s balance:
Higher Balances: Incur a lower burn rate (minimum 0.1%).
Lower Balances: Face a higher burn rate (up to 1%).
These thresholds and rates are adjustable via DAO proposals.

2.4 Developer Withdrawal Grace

Developer funds become available for withdrawal after a predetermined period (e.g., 5 years).
If no withdrawal occurs within 1 year after the withdrawal window opens, the developer’s remaining allocation is automatically transferred to the DAO treasury. This mechanism ensures that if the developer becomes inactive, the funds remain within the ecosystem for community benefit.

2.5 Treasury Management and Voting Controls

DAO Treasury:
15% of the total supply is allocated to the DAO treasury, which funds community initiatives and project improvements.
Voting Requirements:
For treasury-related proposals, voters must hold at least 5% of the allocated treasury tokens.
Vote Weight Calculation:
Votes are weighted using a community-adjustable rate (treasuryVoteWeightRate, expressed in basis points, where 1 basis point equals 0.01%). Each address’s vote weight is capped at a maximum value (treasuryMaxVoteWeight), and a minimum number of unique voters (treasuryMinVoterCount) must participate.
Timelock and Multi-Sig Approvals:
A timelock delay (e.g., 3 days) is enforced after the voting period before execution, and treasury spending proposals require additional multi-signature approvals (e.g., at least 3).
2.6 Security Enhancements

"Code is Law":
The contract is governed entirely by its code, meaning that the rules written in the smart contract are automatically executed without the need for external intervention.
Reentrancy Protection and Pausability:
Critical functions are protected using OpenZeppelin’s ReentrancyGuard, and the contract can be paused during emergencies.
Robust Quorum and Multi-Sig Checks:
Strict quorum requirements and multi-sig approvals ensure that significant changes have widespread community backing.
DAO-Driven Updates:
The system’s key parameters can be updated through DAO proposals, ensuring ongoing adaptability and security.
3. Technical Architecture
Smart Contract Structure:
KeeperCoin DAO Full is built on the ERC20 standard using OpenZeppelin’s libraries, ensuring full compatibility with wallets and exchanges.

Governance Module:
A comprehensive proposal system allows token holders to submit, vote on, and execute proposals using Quadratic Voting. In this system, the vote weight is calculated based on the square root of a voter’s balance, which helps to limit the influence of large token holders.
Deflation & Burn Module:
The contract implements both annual burns and dynamic, transfer-based burns to gradually reduce the total supply.
DAO Governance Flow:
Proposal Submission: Community members create proposals with defined start and end times.
Voting Period: Token holders vote using Quadratic Voting, and proposals track unique voter counts.
Execution: Once the voting period and timelock delay have passed, proposals are executed if they meet quorum, unique voter, and multi-sig requirements.
Autonomous Updates: Key parameters are continuously updated via DAO proposals, allowing the system to adapt to changing conditions.
4. Conclusion
KeeperCoin DAO Full combines innovative deflationary tokenomics with robust, community-driven governance to create a self-sustaining “set it and forget it” ecosystem. With automatic burns, dynamic transfer-based burns, secure developer withdrawal mechanisms, and comprehensive treasury management controls, the system minimizes central control while maximizing security. Thorough testing and security audits are essential before launching on mainnet to ensure the system operates reliably under real-world conditions.
